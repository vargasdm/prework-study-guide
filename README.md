# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This webpage was created in order for me to put all of my Full stack prework note in one location so that they are easy to access, as well as give me a suggested topic of my notes to study. This is done by creating a webpage that has every topic that was covered in the bootcamp prework, with notes under the corresponding header, and JS code that suggests a topic to study first displayed int he console. During this project I have learned how to build a simple webpage using HTML as a framework, CSS to style my webpage, Javascript to add functionality, as well as git and the commandline interface in order to make edits and add features

## Usage

This webpage can be used to review notes that I have taken as I was going through the prework material. TO review the notes, open the webpage containing the four topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
