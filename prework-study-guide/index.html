            <li>CSS class rule:</li>
            <img src="./assets/CSS_rule_diagram.png" alt="Diagram of CSS rule."/>
            <li>The selector defines the elements or attributes we want the declarations to apply to</li>
            <li>The delcaration contains 2 components. The property we want to apply (ex. color) and the value for that property (ex. blue) </li>
            <li>If we want to aply a rule to all the visible elements on a page, the * symbol is used</li>
            <li>You can combine multiple selectors into a single CSS rule by using a comma</li>
            <li>he img selector assigns property values to any image in the markup</li>
            <li>When the display property is assigned with the block value, this makes it so each image is started  on a new line</li>
            <li>We place the link to our style sheet in the head element section because that is where the metadata info goes</li>
            <li>if a period is placed before the selector name it designates the selector as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to this class will gain property assignments from the CSS</li>
            <li>The box-shadow property adds shadow effects around the element's frame. Thius property is explained by x and y offsets. The x offset defines the width of the shadow on the x axis (or to the right of the box).The y offset defines the width of the shadow on the y axis (or below the box)</li>
